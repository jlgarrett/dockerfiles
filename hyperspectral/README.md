the hyperspectral dockerfile is a container that I have found useful for analyzing hyperspectral images for remote sensing applications

it is based off of the jupyter/scipy-notebook Dockerfile

the main change is that the package 'QGIS' has been added

since QGIS is big, this dockerfile takes a while to be built
